# E-Commerce-Data-Analytics-Project

### Objective:
In this project, I will utilize the RFM approach to analyze and segment the customers of an e-commerce company. This approach will help the company to enhance their retention and acquisition strategies, ultimately leading to improved performance.

### Approach:
Successful e-commerce stores have been able to target their desired customers effectively, and customer segmentation has been one of the key techniques they used to achieve this. By segmenting their existing customers based on factors such as purchase frequency and monetary value, these stores were able to tailor their marketing efforts to specific customer groups. This approach proved to be a more cost-effective and efficient alternative to mass marketing strategies in the digital space.

In real-world scenarios, there are often hundreds of variables that can be used for customer segmentation. However, some of the broad characteristics commonly used to segment customers include:
#### Geographic - 
Segments based on country, state, and city. 
#### Demographic - 
Segments based on gender, age, income, education level, etc. 
#### Psychographic - 
Segments based on geography, lifestyle, age and religious beliefs, etc. 
#### Behavior - 
Segments based on consumer personality traits, attitudes, interests, and lifestyles.

### Overview:
I have been given a comprehensive file that contains all the pertinent data pertaining to ecommerce transactions. This valuable data includes the date and time of the sale, the location of the customer's shipping address, and the price of a single unit for the period of 2016 to 2017.
